Raft\cite{raft} is a consensus building algorithm for distributed systems designed for better understandability than Lamport's Paxos\cite{paxos}. While there are multiple implementations of the algorithm, to our knowledge, the original paper and any subsequent papers do not provide any evaluations with respect to Raft performance under different workloads. With this paper, we use the original open source implementation for Raft, LogCabin, and perform a series of experiments on different workloads and varying contention on the system. We attempt to justify the performance observed to the design decision made by Raft protocol.
