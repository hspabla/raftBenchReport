\section{Future Work}

While we evaluated Raft under and without contention, with different workloads, there is still a lot that can be done to benchmark Raft. Firstly, we would like to see how Raft performs as a bigger cluster, for example with 5 servers in a Raft cluster. Secondly, we need to evaluate all the experiments under failures, for both leader and follower; and lastly, compare it with Paxos to learn if it is superior to Paxos in terms of performance. While this is not an exhaustive list of experiments, this is the bare minimum required to be able to benchmark Raft.
