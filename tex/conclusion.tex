\section{Conclusions}

We can observe that Raft performs well under variety of workloads. Latency per request increases almost linearly with increase in concurrent requests. One significant issue is read performance, which is better than write but have significant tail latency. This can be attributed to the fact that leader needs to respond in every read request, and some additional work in involved before it responds. This can be a major issue if Raft cluster is spread across geographical locations. In our opinion, this is something which can be improved. At cost of slightly lower consistency guarantees, if the follower is allowed to respond instead of the leader, read performance can be improved. Overall, we think Raft provides very stable and predictable performance.
